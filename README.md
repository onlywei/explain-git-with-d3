explain-git-with-d3
===================

Use D3 to visualize simple git branching operations.

This simple project is designed to help people understand some basic git concepts visually.

This is my first attempt at using both SVG and D3. I hope it is helpful to you.

I upload the contents of this repository via FTP every once in a while to: http://www.wei-wang.com/ExplainGitWithD3/
so you can just visit that site to use an (almost) up to date version.

UPDATE: the page can now also be accessed via: https://rayantools.github.io/explain-git-with-d3/
